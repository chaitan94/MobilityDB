 * The selectivity of Boolean operators is essential in order to determine 
 * efficient execution plans for queries. The temporal extension defines 
 * several classes of Boolean operators (equal, less than, overlaps, ...),
 * currently 30, each of which can have as left or right arguments a built-in
 * type (such as integer, timestamptz, box, geometry, ...) or a newly defined 
 * type (such as period, tint, ...), currently 33. 
 *
 * There are currently 3,392 operators, each of which is identified by an Oid. 
 * To avoid enumerating all of these operators in the Oid cache, we use a 
 * two-dimensional array containing all possible combinations of 
 * operator/left argument/right argument (currently 23 * 40 * 40 = 36,800 cells). 
 * The invalid combinations will be initialized to 0.
