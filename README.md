MobilityDB
=======

<img src="doc/images/mobilitydb-logo.svg" width="200" alt="MobilityDB Logo" />

MobilityDB is an open source software program that adds support for temporal and spatio-temporal objects to the [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) object-relational database and its spatial extension [PostGIS](http://postgis.net/). MobilityDB follows the [Moving Features](https://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/movingfeatures) specification from the [Open Geospatial Consortium](https://www.opengeospatial.org/) (OGC).

Technically, MobilityDB is implemented as a PostgreSQL [external extension](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/external-extensions.html).

MobilityDB is developed by the Computer & Decision Engineering Department of the [Université Libre de Bruxelles](https://www.ulb.be/) (ULB) under the direction of [Prof. Esteban Zimányi](http://cs.ulb.ac.be/members/esteban/).


Features
--------

* Time types `Period`, `PeriodSet`, and `TimestampSet` which, in addition of the the `TimestampTz` type provided by PostgreSQL,  are used to represent time spans.
* Temporal types `tbool`, `tint`, `tfloat`, and `ttext` which are based on the `bool`, `int`, `float`, and `text` types provided by PostgreSQL and are used to represent basic types that evolve on time.
* Spatio-temporal types `tgeompoint` and `tgeogpoint` which are based on the `geometry` and `geography` types provided by PostGIS (restricted to 2D or 3D points) and are used to represent points that evolve on time.
* Range types `intrange` and `floatrange` which are used to represent ranges of `int` and `float` values.

All these types have associated an extensive set of functions and operators. GiST and SP-GIST index support for these types are also provided.

Status
------
The extension is under development. We are planning to release the first version in late 2019.

Requirements
------------
 - Linux (other UNIX-like systems may work, but remain untested)
 - PostgreSQL == 11
 - CMake >= 3.1
 - PostGIS == 2.5
 - JSON-C
 - Development files for PostgreSQL, PostGIS/liblwgeom, PROJ & JSON-C

Example for Debian-based systems:
```
# install all MobilityDB build dependencies
apt install build-essential cmake postgresql-server-dev-11 liblwgeom-dev libproj-dev libjson-c-dev
```

Building & installation
-----------------------
Here is the gist:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ULB-CoDE-WIT/MobilityDB
$ mkdir MobilityDB/build
$ cd MobilityDB/build
$ cmake ..
$ make
$ sudo make install
$ psql -c 'CREATE EXTENSION MobilityDB CASCADE'
```

You should also set the following in postgresql.conf:
```
shared_preload_libraries = 'postgis-2.5'
max_locks_per_transaction = 128
```

Docker container
-----------------

A docker container with MobilityDB and all its dependencies is available. If you have docker installed in your system you can run:
```
docker run --name "mobilitydb" -d -p 25432:5432 codewit/mobilitydb
```

This command downloads and executes a binary image of PostgreSQL, PostGIS, and MobilityDB with the TCP port 5432 in the container mapped to port 25432 on the Docker host (user = pw = docker, db = mobilitydb). This image is based on [this docker container](https://github.com/kartoza/docker-postgis/), please refer to it for more information.
